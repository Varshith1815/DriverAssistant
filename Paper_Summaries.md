# Identifying Smartphone Users based on Interaction Patterns
`-- Gokul Subramanian`

This paper introduces an innovative method for identifying smartphone users by analyzing their unique behavioral patterns using inertial sensors, including accelerometers and gyroscopes. The goal is to overcome the limitations of conventional authentication methods, such as passwords and biometrics, which are vulnerable to fraudulent activities. The study proposes a novel approach to passive and continuous authentication by examining users' behavioral cues during smartphone interactions.

To validate the effectiveness of this approach, the researchers conducted a study involving 26 participants and 12 unique activities. These activities were categorized into two groups: short-term actions and gestures. Impressively, the proposed scheme produced encouraging results, with the random forests classifier achieving the highest recognition accuracy of 74.97%. This study underscores the critical role of behavioral biometrics in enhancing smartphone security, making a substantial contribution to the current body of literature on implicit authentication methods.

Furthermore, the study provides insights into potential future enhancements, such as incorporating larger datasets and implementing additional sensors. These advancements aim to improve accuracy and explore practical applications in real-life situations.

The app collected information such as Bluetooth, location, and battery  data to observe the experiences of individuals with mental health challenges.

Key findings:

1. Data Collection and Battery Effects:
  Saw a 12% decrease in battery life when scanning every 5 minutes. Most participants reported that it had a noticeable impact on battery life.
   
2. Reason for Acceptance:
   Acceptability was influenced by factors such as objective data collection, trust in the organization collecting the data, and also due to impact on privacy

3. Technical Challenges:
   Technical challenges include reliable sensor data collection on mobile platforms, battery consumption emerged as an important concern, highlighting the need to balance extensive data collection with user expectations regarding battery consumption

4. Behavioral Indicators of Mental Health:
   Analyzed Bluetooth and GPS data for possible behavioral markers. Bluetooth data provided information on user's social evironment while GPS helps with information on location.

The study highlights the promising role of mobile phone sensor technology in mental health research and acknowledges existing challenges. The authors advocate open science, transparent reporting, improved participation and user engagement to address these challenges. They emphasize the need for rigorous research in all aspects of mobile sensor technology applied to mental health.

# A Noticeboard Application Using Context Aware Services: Case of Strathmore University, Kenya

`-- Hariraj Venkatesan`

Using mobile devices and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons, the Strathmore University-developed context-aware noticeboard application provides users with context-based tailored information. Users are able to see, store, log in, and register for notifications sent via BLE beacons. Posts and beacon activation can be controlled by administrators. The program guarantees scalability, intelligent error management, and easy access to notifications. Eighty percent of respondents said that it is useful in improving the efficiency of information transmission in higher education institutions. The solution allows for quick and effective notification retrieval in pertinent circumstances and consists of a web-based backend for administration and a mobile application for stakeholders.

The noticeboard application overcomes the drawbacks of conventional noticeboards by integrating Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons and context-aware services to provide customizable information based on user context. It guarantees scalability, intelligent error management, and easy access to pertinent notifications. It differs from static noticeboards and improves information distribution inside educational institutions with a web-based administrative administration backend that preserves data integrity and enables effective notification retrieval.

Using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons, the Strathmore University noticeboard application transmits unique IDs that are received by mobile devices. A mobile application processes these IDs and compares them with pertinent services stored in the server's database. Constant communication guarantees contextual relevance even if users walk outside of beacon range. The user interface makes it easy to register, log in, see, and save notices, which promotes effective and customized information sharing in the academic setting.

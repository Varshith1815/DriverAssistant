# Driver Assistant UI

Welcome to the Driver Assistant UI project! This mobile application leverages smartphone sensor technologies to enhance road safety by monitoring driver behaviors in real-time. The application is designed to minimize distractions and promote safer driving practices through alerts and gamification.

## Features

- **Real-Time Speed Monitoring:** Utilizes GPS to display current speed and compare it with local speed limits.
- **Alerts:** Provides auditory alerts when the user exceeds speed limits.
- **Crash Detection:** Detects potential crashes and alerts the driver.
- **Gamification:** Encourages safer driving practices by rewarding drivers with points for adhering to speed limits.

# Designing Driving Assistance Alerts that are Least Distractive

## Types of alerts:
**1. Auditory Alerts:**
Auditory alerts, from beeps to speech-based warnings, effectively grab attention. Beeps are notable for alertness, while concise, assertive speech warnings are efficient and favored, as studies [1,2] indicate.

**2. Visual Alerts:**
Visual notifications range from text and symbols to ambient lighting, with effectiveness varying. Older drivers find text distracting, preferring subtler cues like ambient lighting, as per the second study [2].

**3. Multimodal Alerts:**
Combining auditory, visual, and possibly haptic cues is a growing trend. Multimodal systems, especially those blending auditory alerts with ambient lighting, minimize cognitive load and cater to diverse sensory preferences, enhancing alert effectiveness [2].

## How to design less distracive alerts?
**Personalization and Adaptivity:**
The first paper emphasizes tailoring alerts to the driverâ€™s attention and context. Adaptive systems that adjust alert intensity based on distraction and environment can greatly enhance safety and user experience [1].

**Simplicity and Timing:**
Studies agree that notifications should be clear and timely, announced only when necessary to avoid cognitive overload and maintain focus on driving tasks. This prevents drivers from being overwhelmed with information and enhances safety [3,4].

**Preference for Non-Visual Information Delivery:**
Audio notifications are favored over visual ones, allowing drivers to keep their eyes on the road. The use of avatars or visual characters doesn't significantly impact preferences, highlighting the importance of message content and clarity over presentation [3,4].

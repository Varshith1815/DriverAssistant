# Identifying Smartphone Users based on Interaction Patterns

This paper introduces an innovative method for identifying smartphone users by analyzing their unique behavioral patterns using inertial sensors, including accelerometers and gyroscopes. The goal is to overcome the limitations of conventional authentication methods, such as passwords and biometrics, which are vulnerable to fraudulent activities. The study proposes a novel approach to passive and continuous authentication by examining users' behavioral cues during smartphone interactions.

To validate the effectiveness of this approach, the researchers conducted a study involving 26 participants and 12 unique activities. These activities were categorized into two groups: short-term actions and gestures. Impressively, the proposed scheme produced encouraging results, with the random forests classifier achieving the highest recognition accuracy of 74.97%. This study underscores the critical role of behavioral biometrics in enhancing smartphone security, making a substantial contribution to the current body of literature on implicit authentication methods.

Furthermore, the study provides insights into potential future enhancements, such as incorporating larger datasets and implementing additional sensors. These advancements aim to improve accuracy and explore practical applications in real-life situations.

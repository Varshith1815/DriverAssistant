# SHARING DATA COLLECTED WITH SMARTPHONE SENSORS
## WILLINGNESS, PARTICIPATION, AND NONPARTICIPATION BIAS

This research paper explores the use of smartphone sensors to greatly enhance the gathering and interpretation of data in the fields of social and behavioral science. By incorporating sensors such as GPS for tracking location changes and accelerometers for monitoring physical movements, this paper offers a comprehensive approach to comprehending human behavior in a real-life context. Not only does this method provide immediate data collection, but it also allows for a detailed understanding of participants' everyday activities and connections, greatly enriching the accuracy and richness of research findings

This study further delves into the ethical considerations and willingness of participants when it comes to sharing sensor data, a crucial factor in the effectiveness of research methods. It stresses the significance of upholding participant privacy and agency, proposing that clear communication about data usage and strong privacy measures can increase participation rates. The paper examines different factors that impact individuals' choices to share their data, such as the type and sensitivity of the collected sensor data and the perceived level of invasion during the collection process.

This research not only brings attention to the potential obstacles and prejudices that can result from differing levels of participation among diverse demographic groups and sensor tasks, but also stresses the importance of developing tactics to reduce nonparticipation bias and guarantee inclusivity and accuracy in the gathered data. These noteworthy findings open doors for further investigation into more refined and ethical methods for utilizing smartphone sensor data in the realms of social and behavioral sciences, ultimately offering a deeper insight into human behavior through the lens of technology.

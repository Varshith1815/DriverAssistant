Mobile sensors-based platform of Human Physical Activities Recognition for COVID-19 spread minimization

The COVID-19 pandemic spurred the development of mobile health applications for managing and mitigating the virus's spread. Recognizing activities that contribute to transmission, like handshaking and face-touching, became crucial. This research paper discusses a novel approach leveraging smartphone sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and speed sensors to recognize human activities relevant to COVID-19 prevention. This paper builds upon existing activity recognition research, uniquely adapting it to the pandemic context. The study included the development of a mobile app, a specialized dataset, and integrated GPS-based contact tracing offering a comprehensive solution exceeding traditional activity recognition methods.

Core concepts discussed in this paper involve sensor data collection, feature extraction, and classification algorithms like LSTM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM. Researchers delve into these concepts to design an effective pandemic control system. While the study incorporates GPS data for contact tracing, it acknowledges limitations in indoor accuracy. This highlights a critical gap in indoor positioning, suggesting further research on integrating alternative technologies like Bluetooth and WiFi. Additionally, while various classification algorithms are tested, their comparative advantages and disadvantages require deeper exploration.

Several questions emerge from this study. How can indoor positioning accuracy be improved for better contact tracing? What other sensors or technologies can complement GPS data? Is there a need for a hybrid system combining multiple sensors for more accurate activity recognition? How can the chosen classification algorithms be optimized for real-world pandemic control scenarios? The paper offers a comprehensive solution while identifying areas for future exploration. This underscores the evolving nature of the field and the continuous need for innovative approaches to public health challenges.

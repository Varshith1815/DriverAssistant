# A Noticeboard Application Using Context Aware Services: Case of Strathmore University, Kenya

Using mobile devices and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons, the Strathmore University-developed context-aware noticeboard application provides users with context-based tailored information. Users are able to see, store, log in, and register for notifications sent via BLE beacons. Posts and beacon activation can be controlled by administrators. The program guarantees scalability, intelligent error management, and easy access to notifications. Eighty percent of respondents said that it is useful in improving the efficiency of information transmission in higher education institutions. The solution allows for quick and effective notification retrieval in pertinent circumstances and consists of a web-based backend for administration and a mobile application for stakeholders.

The noticeboard application overcomes the drawbacks of conventional noticeboards by integrating Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons and context-aware services to provide customizable information based on user context. It guarantees scalability, intelligent error management, and easy access to pertinent notifications. It differs from static noticeboards and improves information distribution inside educational institutions with a web-based administrative administration backend that preserves data integrity and enables effective notification retrieval.

Using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons, the Strathmore University noticeboard application transmits unique IDs that are received by mobile devices. A mobile application processes these IDs and compares them with pertinent services stored in the server's database. Constant communication guarantees contextual relevance even if users walk outside of beacon range. The user interface makes it easy to register, log in, see, and save notices, which promotes effective and customized information sharing in the academic setting.

To incorporate a speedometer display and speed alerts into a React Native app leveraging the GPS sensor, we can utilize the React Native framework's capabilities to access the device's native GPS functionality. This process involves using the `react-native-geolocation-service` or similar libraries that provide access to the device's GPS sensor. Through these libraries, the app can obtain real-time geolocation data, including the speed at which the device (and therefore, the vehicle) is moving. The speed data, typically provided in meters per second, can be converted into the desired unit (e.g., miles per hour or kilometers per hour) and displayed on the user interface as a speedometer reading.

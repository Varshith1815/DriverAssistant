Significance of Accelerometers and Gyroscopes for Enhancing Driving Safety
1.Data Precision:
Accelerometers and gyroscopes enhance the accuracy of data collected from the smartphone's sensors.
2.Crucial for Speed Monitoring:
Accelerometers play a key role in determining acceleration and deceleration, vital for accurate speed calculations.
Gyroscopes aid in measuring angular velocity, aiding in assessing the vehicle's speed and changes in direction.
3.Responsive Alert Systems:
Accelerometers enable the detection of sudden movements, such as those indicative of a crash.
Gyroscopes contribute to identifying abrupt changes in orientation, further enhancing the responsiveness of the crash detection feature.

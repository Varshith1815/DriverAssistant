**1. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS):**

* **Types of alerts:** Provides data for visual alerts (speed display) and can be used for multimodal alerts with auditory warnings when exceeding the limit.
* **Benefits:** Continuously tracks location and speed. Reliable and widely available technology.
* **Considerations:** Requires access to clear skies for optimal signal reception.

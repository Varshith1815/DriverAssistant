# Exploring Sensor Integration for In-Vehicle Alerts and Crash Detection

**1. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS):**

* **Types of alerts:** Provides data for visual alerts (speed display) and can be used for multimodal alerts with auditory warnings when exceeding the limit.
* **Benefits:** Continuously tracks location and speed. Reliable and widely available technology.
* **Considerations:** Requires access to clear skies for optimal signal reception.

**2. Accelerometer:**

* **Types of alerts:** Primarily used for detecting potential crashes through sudden changes in acceleration (deceleration in case of a collision).
* **Benefits:** Can be used for crash detection in addition to speed monitoring.
* **Considerations:** Not directly involved in speed monitoring unless combined with GNSS data.

**3. Gyroscope:**

* **Types of alerts:** Can contribute to multimodal alerts by detecting sudden changes in the vehicle's orientation (e.g., sharp turns), which could be an indicator of potential risky driving behavior.
* **Benefits:** Provides additional data for a more comprehensive understanding of vehicle behavior.
* **Considerations:** Not directly involved in speed monitoring and requires additional processing for meaningful insights.

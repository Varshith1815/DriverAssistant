# Metrics and/or Methods which will be useful to test the application's accuracy
## Here are some of the methods which we can use to test some important features:
**1. Speedometer display:**
We can assess the speed shown by the app by comparing it to the car's built-in speedometer while driving on a flat, straight road. To accomplish this, we'll utilize various speed increments (such as 10, 30, 50, and 70 mph) and determine the average variance between the two measurements.

**2. Speed limit alert:**
To evaluate the accuracy of the app's speed limit display, we will compare it with the official speed limit signs and data from mapping services. This involves driving on a variety of roads with known speed limits, ranging from highways to city streets and residential areas, and comparing the speed limit alerts provided by the app with the actual speed limits. This method allows us to assess the app's accuracy in different contexts and environments.

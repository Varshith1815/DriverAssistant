Title: "Challenges and Opportunities in the Use of Mobile Phone Sensor Technology for Mental Health Assessment: A Feasibility Study".

Summary:

This paper explores the potential of mobile phone sensor technology to extract behavioral indicators for mental health research. This study using the Socialize app developed at the Black Dog Institute highlights the technical challenges and user acceptance of passive data collection. The app collected information such as Bluetooth, location, and battery  data to observe the experiences of individuals with mental health challenges.

Key findings:

1. Data Collection and Battery Effects:
  Saw a 12% decrease in battery life when scanning every 5 minutes. Most participants reported that it had a noticeable impact on battery life.
   
2. Reason for Acceptance:
   Acceptability was influenced by factors such as objective data collection, trust in the organization collecting the data, and also due to impact on privacy

3. Technical Challenges:
   Technical challenges include reliable sensor data collection on mobile platforms, battery consumption emerged as an important concern, highlighting the need to balance extensive data collection with user expectations regarding battery consumption

4. Behavioral Indicators of Mental Health:
   Analyzed Bluetooth and GPS data for possible behavioral markers. Bluetooth data provided information on user's social evironment while GPS helps with information on location.

The study highlights the promising role of mobile phone sensor technology in mental health research and acknowledges existing challenges. The authors advocate open science, transparent reporting, improved participation and user engagement to address these challenges. They emphasize the need for rigorous research in all aspects of mobile sensor technology applied to mental health.
